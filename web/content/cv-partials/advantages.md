Some of my advantages include:

- **being a constant learner**:
  I'm excellent at identifying what I donâ€™t know and how to find the answers I need, so lack of knowledge or experience in technology required in a project is only another opportunity to learn
- **taking pride in my engineering work**:
  I always try to deliver the best quality product (e.g. code, infrastructure, documentation, advice) in the best possible way; obviously, that is not always possible, but when a tradeoff is necessary, it must always be understood and justified
- **desire to automate**:
  automation not only means I have more time for creative and interesting work, it also documents the process and makes it repeatable safely
- **experience with product management and customer relationships**:
  I have a lot of experience with internal customers, as well as some with external customers, from times when I worked as a freelance web developer
- **experience with incident management**:
  on every stage of my career I was developing monitoring solutions, coordinating incidents (calls, status updates, gathering SMEs), leading blameless post-mortem sessions and preparing RCA documents (both internal technical ones and for external customers)
- **understanding of multilayer nature of computer systems**:
  nowadays, it seems quite rare for engineer to be touching and having at least basic understanding multiple layers of computer systems (including physical entities, operating systems, networks, middleware protocols and applications themselves); to me this is vital part of work
