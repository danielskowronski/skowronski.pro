I'm an IT engineer with experience and interest in many areas that include systems administration (**SysAdmin/SysOps** with primary focus on Linux systems), **infrastructure engineering** and **cyber-security**. I like to refer to myself as a **hacker** in the original meaning of that word - *a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means*.
