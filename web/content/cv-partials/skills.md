- **containerization and virtualization**: creation and optimization of small **Docker** images, management of stateful containers (**LXD**), basic operation and deployment of **Kubernetes (k8s)** clusters, managing virtual machines (**VMware**, **KVM**)
- **Linux**: daily low-level debugging, Gentoo compilation, small application clusters
- **MS Windows**: although I don't want to work with it more than occasional checks, I can get data from Active Directory, use PowerShell, set up IIS or perform troubleshooting
- **cyber-security**:
    - basics of architecture and protocols used in internet applications like HTTPS, proper PKI, JWT and PGP
    - threats and defences to common mistakes, vulnerabilities and bad actors like ones listed in OWASP TOP10, phishing, DDoS attacks, buffer overflow and others
- **databases**: small instances and clusters configuration (**MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**), SQL queries, ORM libraries; data analysis and mining (**SQLite** and structured documents - **JSON**, **YAML**)
- **high-level programming** (recently mostly **Go**, some exposure to C++ and Java): developing simple programs, run-time debugging, reverse engineering and improving existing ones
- **scripting**: developing scripts during my entire career for various tasks including automation of repetitive tasks, orchestration of build and deployments and data parsing; most experience with **Python**, **bash**, **Perl** and **awk**.
- **low-level programming** (mostly x86 assembly): debugging compiled programs, basic understanding of memory management and CPU related concepts (like branch prediction)
- **hardware** especially in embedded solutions: simple programming, awareness of key concepts, experience in debugging
- **networks**: some experience in all ISO/OSI model layers, mostly transport and session; tasks ranging from tcpdump analysis and manual communication with servers using text protocols (like HTTP/1.1 and SMTP) to VPN and IPsec tunnel configuration
- **cloud**: no matter the automation tools (**Ansible**, **Terraform**, **Puppet**) or if it is private on-prem solution based on VMware or LXD, public solution like AWS or even hybrid cloud - the principles are similar; my experience is related to both direct cloud solutions engineering and assisting development teams that in some organizations treat cloud as infinite cost-less resource, while in reality *itâ€™s just someone else's computer*
