Please don't hesitate to reach me at [daniel@skowron.ski](mailto:daniel@skowron.ski) or via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/daniel-skowronski/). 

**If you call me and I don't answer, please leave voicemail, send SMS or e-mail.** I'll try to respond to you in timely fashion.

Please keep in mind that I'm extremely organized, value my time highly and my schedule is busy. Therefore:
- phone calls should be last resort, especially as a means to schedule video-conference
- written communication helps in proper confirmation of my availability and follow-up calendar invite (even for a phone call) helps both parties to remember about it
- if you use automated systems to send job offers, I may be using similar tools to respond to them
- please check [FAQ for recruiters](/faq/) as in numerous instances it saves time for both parties
