My contact details are listed on the [Contact](/contact/) page. This article answers common questions from recruitment process.

- I really appreciate when the first message from the recruiter defines experience expectations and salary range. This saves time for both sides.
- For the foreseeable future, I'm interested only in employment contract / *Umowa o Pracę*. Moreover, in Poland **there is no such thing as B2B *employment***. Please review `Art. 22 § 1.2 KP` and  `Art. 281. KP`.
- While I value in-person communication and team integration, COVID-19 pandemic proven remote work in IT works. 
  - Therefore, **I'm not considering any companies that would require presence in the office for more than 20% of time.** 
  - Monthly or quarterly meetings in other cities are welcome.
- I strongly value flexible working time that allows to concentrate high focus work time when employees have their peak performance.
  - This does not mean I reject the need for fixed time window designed for meetings, rather indicates that sometimes my productivity is highest during evening hours.
- I'm not interested in positions that would involve maintaining Windows Server, SQL Server or any other Microsoft business applications for more than 10% of a typical working month.
- Screening quizzes/tests and "homework" assignments are good. Lack of proper technical verification and wasted time are awful.
- Different companies have different job titles. I don't care if I'm hired as "junior engineer" after working as "senior engineer" in previous company, as long as I'm growing and money is good.
- Different companies have different approaches to various parts of IT, especially when comparing startup with corporation. Please don't assume my experience with technology X means I know everything about all related components.
- My notice period is standard on employment contract for my working period (as visible on [Professional experience](/professional-experience/) page).
