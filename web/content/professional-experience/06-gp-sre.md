On this position, I was maintaining and improving operational processes for a broad range of Big Data processing systems, as well as took part in on-call rotation. From an infrastructure point of view, I worked with tools deployed on Linux VMs to private on-prem cloud based on Puppet and to AWS. Some parts of my work required work with MS SQL procedures.
