I was working on automation and orchestration of client-deployable systems on operating system level (package management, virtualization of internal components, hardware compatibility). Other than the actual project code (mostly bash, Python, RedHat configuration files) I was maintaining CI/CD for physical hardware (Jenkins).

This short adventure with Scrum-based Software Development for offline solutions (i.e. no live systems or operations work) let me understand that my skills are best used with a more dynamic work environment.
